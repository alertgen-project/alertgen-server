/** Log Level
 *
 "fatal" (60): The service/app is going to stop or become unusable now. An operator should definitely look into this soon.
 "error" (50): Fatal for a particular request, but the service/app continues servicing other requests. An operator should look at this soon(ish).
 "warn" (40): A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
 "info" (30): Detail on regular operation.
 "debug" (20): Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
 "trace" (10): Logging from external libraries used by your app or very detailed application logging.
